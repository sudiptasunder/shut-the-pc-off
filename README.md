### Program Description ###

This Python program is designed to provide users with an easy and flexible way to manage their computer's shutdown and restart operations using command line commands through the `os` module. It allows users to schedule shutdowns and restarts at a specific time, offering a convenient way to automate these tasks without manual intervention. Additionally, the program includes functionality to abort a scheduled shutdown or restart, as well as a cheat code feature for instant shutdown.

#### Key Features ####

1. **Scheduled Shutdown/Restart**:
   - Users can specify a time in seconds after which the computer will automatically shutdown or restart. This is particularly useful for situations where you need to leave the computer running for a certain task but want it to shut down or restart once the task is complete.

2. **Abort Functionality**:
   - The program allows users to abort a scheduled shutdown or restart, providing flexibility in case the user changes their mind or needs to continue using the computer.

3. **Instant Shutdown with Cheat Code**:
   - For quick and immediate shutdowns, the program includes a cheat code feature. By entering the specified cheat code, users can bypass the timer and shutdown the computer instantly. This is useful for emergencies or when you need to quickly power off the system.

#### Use Cases ####

- **Automated System Maintenance**:
  - Schedule restarts to apply updates or perform system maintenance during off-hours without manually monitoring the process.
  
- **Energy Savings**:
  - Ensure that your computer doesn't stay on unnecessarily by scheduling it to shut down after completing long-running tasks, such as downloading large files or rendering videos.

- **Convenience and Control**:
  - Gain more control over your computer's power state with the ability to abort scheduled actions, ensuring that you can adapt to changing circumstances without losing work or productivity.

#### How to Use ####

1. **Scheduling a Shutdown/Restart**:
   - Run the program and input the desired time (in seconds) for the shutdown or restart.
   - The program will confirm the scheduled action and execute it after the specified duration.

2. **Aborting a Scheduled Action**:
   - If you need to cancel a scheduled shutdown or restart, select the abort option from the window within the program. This will immediately stop any pending shutdown or restart operations.

3. **Using the Cheat Code for Immediate Shutdown**:
   - Enter the predefined cheat code into the program to trigger an instant shutdown of the computer, bypassing any timers or delays.

This program is an excellent tool for anyone looking to automate their computer's power management, offering both scheduled and immediate options with user-friendly commands.
